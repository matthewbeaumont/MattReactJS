  <h1>Javascript tests</h1>
  <p>This website is for testing Javascript.</p>

  <h2>JavaScript contained in the HTML document</h2>
  <p id="javascriptindoc">Text before</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="function1()">Click to make text appear</button>
  <script>
    function function1() {
      document.getElementById("javascriptindoc").innerHTML =
        "Paragraph has been changed by the Javascript";
    }
  </script>
  <!-- The button has an onclick attribute of "function1()". This causes  -->

  <h2>JavaScript contained in the an an external Javascript document</h2>
  <p id="external">Text before</p>
  <button type="button" onclick="function2()">Click to make text appear</button>
  <pre>
  &lt;script src="Javascript/javascript1.js";&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
  </pre>
  <p>The above code is a script that imports the javascript1.js file</p>
  <p>
    Inside the javascript1.js file is a function (in this case "function2").
  </p>
  <p>
    The button has an "onclick" event whereby it runs function2 when clicked.
  </p>
  <pre>
    function function2() {
      document.getElementById("external").innerHTML="Paragraph has been changed by the external Javascript";}
  </pre>
  <h2>Different Javascript outputs</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Write into an HTML element.</li>
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick="document.getElementById('hahaha').innerHTML='to get to the other side'"
    >
      Click to change the paragraph below
    </button>
    <p id="hahaha">why did the chicken cross the road?</p>
    <li>Write into the HTML output.</li>
    <script>
      document.write(5 + 20);
    </script>
    <button
      type="button"
      onclick="document.write('Web page overwritten. Refresh to restore page')"
    >
      click and the document.write feature will overwrite the webpage.
    </button>
    <!-- The button above for document write required the id and string to be in single quotes. -->
    <!-- Double quotes caused an error because they sit is the same hierachy level as the double quotes that surround the script. -->

    <li>write into an alert box.</li>
    <button type="buton" onclick="function3()">click me</button>
    <li>Write into the browser console.</li>
    <p>
      Open the developer tools in the browser to see a message "hello world" in
      the Console section of the tools. This message is added by Javascript.
      console.log ("hello World")
    </p>
  </ol>

  <footer>
    <script src="Javascript/javascript1.js" ;></script>
    <!-- The filepath is foldername forward slash file name. If the folder was one level back I would need to write ../ 
      before the folder name and repeat that for every level back I need to go. All the JavaScript within the extenal file is available. -->
    <!-- The benefit of having the script in the footer is that it is the last thing to load and Javascript can slow down load times.  -->
